- [Helpful hints from classmates on more efficiently changing classes (in response to my issue)](https://github.com/susanBuck/e28-fall19/issues/69)
- Additional resources referenced for my first draft (these approaches were no longer needed when I found better ways to work with classes and computed properties)
   - [Why can't I use Array.forEach on a collection of Javascript elements? (StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39797101/why-cant-i-use-array-foreach-on-a-collection-of-javascript-elements) (referenced in my first draft but no longer needed as I ultimately found a way to avoid `document.getElementsByClass`)
   - [Element.classList (MDN web docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)
   - [Disabling a button immediately (and update the DOM) on a function call (VueJS discussion repo)](https://github.com/vuejs/Discussion/issues/297)


## Notes for instructor
I noticed your use of the mystery word example in the video on computed properties but didn't reference your code directly when updating my application to use Vue.
