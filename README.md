# Single-Page Applications & Interfaces with Vue.js (E-28)
Coursework for <a href="https://hesweb.dev/e28">DGMD E-28</a>, Single-Page Applications & Interfaces with Vue.js, taken as a graduate-level course at Harvard Extension School in the fall of 2019. Multiple projects were built incrementally over the course of the class, adding in new Vue.js functionality as we went. 

### <a href="https://github.com/terichadbourne/e28/tree/master/p2">Potty Talk</a>
A mystery word guessing game to accompany the <a href="http://toilettranscripts.com/">Toilet Transcripts</a>. 

This project uses single file components in Vue.js.

### <a href="https://github.com/terichadbourne/e28/tree/master/p4">Rants & Raves</a>

This is an MVP of an app that could be used to share feedback among company employees. In the current data structure, each employee has a single rant and a single rave maximum.

There are currently 3 defined "pages":

- People (view a list of all employees with their rants and raves)
- Rants (view all rants anonymously or filter down to view just favorites)
- Raves (view all raves anonymously or filter down to view just favorites)

Clicking on a specific rant or rave takes you a page with more detail, including the person the feedback is from.

While on Rants or Raves pages or looking at a specific piece of feedback, the user can mark it as a favorite. (In a real-world application, this could be used to judge where employees are in alignment on their opinions.)

This project uses Vue.js, VueX, Firebase, Cypress and Mocha.
